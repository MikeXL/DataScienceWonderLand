Personally, I like this quote, as we shall not care only the volume, but the interesting piece of the data to make it useful.

> What is big data? Its bigness is actually not the most interesting characteristic > ... big data is a **paradigm shift**
> in how you **think** about data assets, where you **collect** them, how you > **analyze** them,
> and how you **monetize** the insights from the analysis.

### Scale Up vs. Scale Out Approach

- Scale Up (Vertically) means adding more computing power to a single node
- Scale Out (horizontally) means adding more node

### Sharding

What the heck is that? Partition across server farms. Again, name the old thing to make it new again.

### \*Schema

In case you have not heard of [dimensional modeling] [1] and star schema yet, it has been there for decades. A star schema is what it looks like, a star, i.e. a data table comes with multiple look up tables.
