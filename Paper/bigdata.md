Personally, I like this quote, as we shall not care only the volume, but the interesting piece of the data to make it useful.

> What is big data? Its bigness is actually not the most interesting characteristic > ... big data is a **paradigm shift**
> in how you **think** about data assets, where you **collect** them, how you > **analyze** them,
> and how you **monetize** the insights from the analysis.
