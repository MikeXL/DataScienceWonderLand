Commandments
======
1. Respect
2. Backup
3. Versions
4. Life's short
5. Simplicity
6. Challenge
7. Observe

## respect the power, respect others
I often copy "great power comes with great responsibilities" when I send super user privilige to others. As when one join that admin council, it becomes the responsibility to look after each other, and look after the one you serving.

When making any changes, consult prior action. 

When in doubt, ask

## backup is your friend
yes, how many times stupid moves have been made and wish there was a backup. 
Yes, make your own wish becomes true.

## version control is your other friend
how many times, our own code been mess up by the same person, and shout at the wall f~!@#$%^&
if you have a version control and have every changes checked in, you CAN travel back in time.

## life's short
It took me a long time to figure this one secret out. There are lotsa other beautiful things out there rather than work and technologies.

## simplicity
"Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler" ... Einstein

"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible" ... Alan Kay

"It takes a lot of hard work," Jobs said, "to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions."

## challenge
"We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, *not because they are easy, but because they are hard*, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too." ... JFK

## observation
In another word, pay attention to the details

"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes." ... Sherlock Holmes

"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear." ... SH


## making story
Making story is not the same as making things up.

"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts." ... Sherlock Holmes

"Insufficient facts always invite danger." ... Spock
