Commandments
======

## respect the power, respect others
I often copy "great power comes with great responsibilities" when I send super user privilige to others. As when one join that admin council, it becomes the responsibility to look after each other, and look after the one you serving.
When making any changes, consult prior action. 
When in doubt, ask

## backup is your friend
yes, how many times stupid moves have been made and wish there was a backup. Yes, make your own wish becomes true.

## version control is your other friend
how many times, our own code been mess up by the same person, and shout at the wall f~!@#$%^&
if you have a version control and have every changes checked in, you CAN travel back in time.
