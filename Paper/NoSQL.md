First if all, *NoSQL* does not mean NOT SQL, rather *not only* SQL. It actually should be named *non-rel*. Therefore, consider it is an addition to the relational data model to model the loose schema semi structured or unstructured data while relational is tend to be rigid on schema and structurize data. 

Some players. 

### Redis
Among all the *NoSQL* implemtations, i found myself quite comfortable with *Redis* than others, just name few - *MongoDB*, *Cassandra*, *CouchDB*. 
Redis is simple and easy to get up abd running. As I am not using it in production yet, havenâ€™t hit any wall. Found the *CLI*, R *rredis* package and Python *redis-py* are quite easy to pickup. 

### Cassandra
DataStax community server is the one that I am experimenting right now via *RCassandra* package. 

### MongoDB


### CouchDB
