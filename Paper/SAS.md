Brilliant to separate things into two *data* and *process*. Well, that is how we design software back in â€™70s, old school. But works. In a way, I like SAS, but never liked their GUI or IDE such as the _Enterprise Guide_. 

As I am ravemping up my knowlegea of R, SAS, SPSS and Tableau, thinking maybe it is a good opportunity to put them under a test. Well a simple predictive modeling test: 

* What will my store sales look like next month? Next quarter? For a particular product?
* What is my most profitable product? Market? Customer?
* What is the customer visit pattern? Peak hours? 

Now I have both the dataset and business problem defined. The rest is to find time to solve it ;)
