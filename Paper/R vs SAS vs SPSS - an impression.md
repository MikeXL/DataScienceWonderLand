### Executive Summary
First of all, letâ€™s start with the *what-if*s
If you are a coder, choose R or SAS, both works well on coding and quite neat and straightforward when working with code than UI I found. R has a Mac distro, that is more attractive to me. 
SPSS Modeler is a point-and-click, quite simple and easy to use in that term. Best in class for user experience.
