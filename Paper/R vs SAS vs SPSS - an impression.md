### Executive Summary
First of all, letâ€™s start with the *what-if*s.   
If you are a coder or hacker type in your blood, choose R.  Or SAS, both works well on coding, quite neat and straightforward when working with code than UI I found. R has a Mac distro, that is more attractive to me.     
SPSS Modeler is a point-and-click, quite simple and easy to use in that term. Best in class for user experience.

### Code

### GUI
Now lets talk a bit about GUI clients. *SAS* has EG (Enterprise Guide), EM (Enterprise Miner) though I have not figures how to work with it; i found myself comfortable with both interactive and batch mode on SAS server. 

*R* has RStudio, Rcmdr (R Commander) and Rattle asI know. But again I mostly using the terminal on my Mac along with a little bit all three above to keep myself productive. 

### Configuration
**R**: Mac OS X Maverick, Quad Cores CPU, 8 GB Memory, version 3.0.3  
**SAS**: SPARC M5000, 64 GB Memory, Version 9.2  
**SPSS Modeler**: forgot, provided by IBM in a workshop
