Brrr ... Big Data
=======================

Personally, I like this quote, as we shall not care only the volume, but the interesting piece of the data to make it useful.

> What is big data? Its bigness is actually not the most interesting characteristic … big data is a **paradigm shift** in how you **think** about data assets, where you **collect** them, how you **analyze** them, and how you **monetize** the insights from the analysis.
*Ralph Kimball, The Data Warehouse Toolkit*


## Scale Up vs. Scale Out Approach

- Scale Up (Vertically) means adding more computing power to a single node
- Scale Out (horizontally) means adding more node

## Sharding

What the heck is that? Partition across server farms. Again, name the old thing to make it new again.

## \*Schema

In case you have not heard of [dimensional modelling] [1] and star schema yet, it has been there for decades. A star schema is what it looks like, a star, i.e. a data table comes with multiple look up tables.

## Data Science and Data Scientist
A data scientist’s secret weapon is their `communication skills` and their ability to `tell the story` about *the* data. From [SAS Big Data Smaller mini series][2].

## Players on the field
### Cassandra

### Redis

### Mongodb

### Hadoop (MapR, Hortonworks, Cloudera)

### How small when everything gets started, not so long ago
>“When I became president, there were only 50 sites on the Internet. More than that have been added since I started talking,” said Clinton.
